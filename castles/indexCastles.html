                        William of Corbeil, Archbishop of Canterbury, with the support of Henry I, constructed the Norman tower-keep of Kentish ragstone in the year 1127. It still stands 113 feet tall and consists of three levels above a basement. Before entering the keep at first floor level, one must pass through a towering, projecting forebuilding with its own system of defences.<br><br>
                        The stronghold, held by insurgent barons, withstood a protracted King John assault in 1215. John set a mine under the keep, sending its southern corner tumbling down after first destroying the outside wall with the fat of 40 pigs. Even though, the defenders persisted for two months before finally giving up due to starvation.<br><br>
                        The castle was rebuilt under the reigns of Henry III and Edward I, and it served as a stronghold until the sixteenth century.

                        The phrase "loveliest castle in the world" has been used to describe Leeds Castle in Kent, England. This Domesday-listed castle has served as a Norman fortress, a royal house, and a royal palace. The location, on two islands in a lovely lake, is breathtaking.<br><br>
                        A Saxon royal family controlled the Royal Manor when it was first constructed in 857 AD. The first stone fortress was being constructed there after the Norman Conquest.<br><br>
                        The Castle was transformed into a royal residence for Edward I and his wife Eleanor of Castile in 1278. The castle underwent significant renovations during the reign of Edward I. Due to its three distinct components, each of which has its own entrance, drawbridge, gateway, and portcullis, the Barbican, which was built at this period, is special. In honour of Queen Eleanor, the mediaeval Keep, which includes the Great Hall, is known as the Gloriette.<br><br>
                        The ideal setting for your day out is Leeds Castle, which is situated on 500 acres of gorgeous countryside. Visitors may look forward to the mediaeval castle, magnificent grounds, activities, and event schedule.
